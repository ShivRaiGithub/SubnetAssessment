# AVAX-Advanced
## Subnet Assessment

These Solidity contracts contains simple programs that allow someone to work with tokens. The deployment and testing were done on an avalanche subnet on local-network.




## Description

The code has 2 contracts : ERC20.sol and vault.sol.
ERC20.sol has commands which work with tokens while vault.sol contains an ERC20 interface (IERC20) and a contract vault containing commands to work with tokens in someone's account using IERC20.
Some functions are : mint, burn, transfer, approve, etc.



## Getting Started

### Installing
You can use Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org) online to interact with the smart contracts. Remix provides accounts with Eth so you can work with them.
However for this, a subnet was created on avalanche along with a Virtual Machine and then the demo / tests were carried out.


### Executing program

You can deploy the contracts on Remix and start interacting with them.
Copy / fork contracts and then click compile to compile the contracts. Afterwards click on deploy and the contract will be deployed to interact with it.
